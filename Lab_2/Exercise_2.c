/*Write a recursive C program to implement Selection Sort using pointers.
• The recursive function should sort the array using the Selection Sort algorithm.
• Access and manipulate the array elements using pointers (i.e., avoid using arr[i]
style directly).
• The program should read the array from the user in the main function, call the
recursive sorting function, and display the sorted array.*/
